"research on the implications of anxiety in parkinson 's disease ( pd ) has been neglected despite its prevalence in nearly 50% of patients and its negative impact on quality of life . 
 previous reports have noted that neuropsychiatric symptoms impair cognitive performance in pd patients ; however , to date , no study has directly compared pd patients with and without anxiety to examine the impact of anxiety on cognitive impairments in pd . 
 this study compared cognitive performance across 50 pd participants with and without anxiety ( 17 pda+ ; 33 pda ) , who underwent neurological and neuropsychological assessment . 
 group performance was compared across the following cognitive domains : simple attention / visuomotor processing speed , executive function ( e.g. , set - shifting ) , working memory , language , and memory / new verbal learning . 
 results showed that pda+ performed significantly worse on the digit span forward and backward test and part b of the trail making task ( tmt - b ) compared to the pda group . 
 there were no group differences in verbal fluency , logical memory , or tmt - a performance . in conclusion , 
 anxiety in pd has a measurable impact on working memory and attentional set - shifting .","overall , neuropsychiatric symptoms in pd have been shown to be negatively associated with cognitive performance . for example , higher depression scores have been correlated with lower scores on the mini - mental state exam ( mmse ) [ 8 , 9 ] as well as tests of memory and executive functions ( e.g. , attention ) [ 1014 ] . the first study found that working memory performance was worse in lpd patients with anxiety compared to rpd patients without anxiety , whereas the second study reported that , in lPD , apathy but not anxiety was associated with performance on nonverbally mediated executive functions and visuospatial tasks ( e,g.., tmt - b , wms - iii spatial span ) , while in rpd , anxiety but not apathy significantly correlated with performance in verbally mediated tasks (e.g., , clock reading test and boston naming test ) . taken together , it is evident that there are limited and inconsistent findings describing the relationship between anxiety and cognition in pds and more specifically how anxiety might influence particular domains of cognition such as attention and memory and frontal functioning . it is also striking that , to date , no study has examined the influence of anxiety on cognition in Pd by directly"

 methods : this was a cross - sectional study involving outpatients with asthma under treatment at a tertiary care university hospital in the city of rio de janeiro , brazil . 
 consecutive patients were divided into two groups according to the severity of asthma based on the global initiative for asthma criteria : mild asthma ( ma ) , comprising patients with mild intermittent or persistent asthma ; and moderate or severe asthma ( msa ) . 
 we determined the serum levels of staphylococcal toxin - specific ige antibodies , comparing the results and performing a statistical analysis . 
 results : the study included 142 patients : 72 in the ma group ( median age = 46 years ; 59 females ) and 70 in the msa group ( median age = 56 years ; 60 females ) . in the sample as a whole , 62 patients ( 43.7% ) presented positive results for staphylococcal toxin - specific ige antibodies : staphylococcal enterotoxin a ( sea ) , in 29 ( 20.4% ) ; seb , in 35 ( 24.6% ) ; sec , in 33 ( 23.2% ) ; and toxic shock syndrome toxin ( tsst ) , in 45 ( 31.7% ) .

"background : since the family is a social system , the impairment in each of its component members may disrupt the entire family system . 
 one of the stress sources for families is accidents leading to hospitalization particularly in the intensive care unit ( icu ) . in many cases , 
 the families needs in patient care are not met that cause dissatisfaction . since the nurses spend a lot of time with patients and their families , they are in a good position to assess their needs and perform appropriate interventions . 
 therefore , this study was conducted to determine the effectiveness of nursing interventions based on family needs on family satisfaction level of hospitalized patients in the neurosurgery icu.materials and methods : this clinical trial was conducted in the neurosurgery icu of al - zahra hospital , isfahan , iran in 2010 . 
 sixty four families were selected by simple sampling method and were randomly placed in two groups ( test and control ) using envelopes . in the test group , 
 some interventions were performed to meet their needs . in the control group , 
 the routine actions were only carried out . 
 the satisfaction questionnaire was completed by both groups two days after admission and again on the fourth day.findings:both of the intervention and control groups were compared in terms of the mean satisfaction scores before and after intervention . 
 there was no significant difference in mean satisfaction scores between test and control groups before the intervention . 
 the mean satisfaction score significantly increased after the intervention compared to the control group.conclusions:nursing interventions based on family needs of hospitalized patients in the icu increase their satisfaction . 
 attention to family nursing should be planned especially in the icus .",", their satisfaction level is another important source of stress for the patient s family . since , how families deal with mental stress is the most important components of comprehensive care , it should be known that attention to the family needs of the patients hospitalized in intensive care units could increase their satisfaction and thus a reduction in stress disorders . however , the nurses spend a lot of time with the patients and their families and are in a good position to assess their needs and plan for meeting these needs with appropriate interventions . today , there are many theories expressed that in intensive Care units , the patient and his family should be considered as a single unit . by providing care to this unit , the aim of this study was to analyze the satisfaction of the families of icu patients . in 2008 also showed that the increase in the availability of physicians for giving the information to the patient  family and as well as nurses efforts to provide understandable explanations about the patient sign satisfaction . this clinical trial was performed with respect to the existing gap for a study carried out for investigating the interventions for the satisfaction and the patients in the special care units and their Families in iran . the purpose of the study wasto determine the effectiveness of nursing interventions based on family needs on family satisfaction level of hospitalized patients"

"molecular therapeutics for treating epidermal growth factor receptor-(egfr- ) expressing cancers are a specific method for treating cancers compared to general cell loss with standard cytotoxic therapeutics . 
 however , the finding that resistance to such therapy is common in clinical trials now dampens the initial enthusiasm over this targeted treatment . 
 yet an improved molecular understanding of other receptor tyrosine kinases known to be active in cancer has revealed a rich network of cross - talk between receptor pathways with a key finding of common downstream signaling pathways . 
 such cross talk may represent a key mechanism for resistance to egfr - directed therapy . 
 here we review the interplay between egfr and met and the type 1 insulin - like growth factor receptor ( igf-1r ) tyrosine kinases , as well as their contribution to anti - egfr therapeutic resistance in the context of squamous cell cancer of the head and neck , a tumor known to be primarily driven by egfr - related oncogenic signals .","given this association , patients with head and neck squamous cell cancers are well positioned to benefit from existing and future molecular targeted agents directed against oncogenic rtks such as egfr ( reviewed in ) . ligand binding to the extracellular domain of rtsks induces receptor dimerization and activation of rtk activity . this review highlights three rtk signaling pathways involved in head and head squamous- cell carcinoma ; egfr , the type 1 insulin - like growth factor receptor ( igf-1r ) and the hepatocyte growth factor ( hgf ) receptor ( met ) . each receptor , with the exception of erbb3 , contain an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain that is activated by binding to extracllular egf - like ligands , which result in receptor dimersization and hence activation of downstream signaling cascades including mapk , pi3k / akt and stat signaling . cetuximab has been approved for use in combination with radiation for treating patients with locally advanced hnscc   and as monotherapy for patients with recurrent hnsCC . gefitinib ( iressa ) is a small molecule tki - targeted to the intrace"

"bivalirudin has been proposed as the sole anticoagulant in patients under extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ( ecmo ) or cardiopulmonary bypass . 
 owing to the pharmacodynamic properties of bivalirudin , areas of blood stagnation should be carefully avoided in order to limit the risk of thrombosis . 
 the ecmo circuit has no reservoir and is usually devoid of blood stagnation areas . 
 conversely , under some circumstances , intracardiac blood stagnation areas may exist . in this case 
 , there is a potential risk for the spontaneous formation of an intracardiac thrombus . 
 we suggest that , under bivalirudin anticoagulation , a minimal degree of intracardiac blood flow with left heart valve movement is allowed .","in a recent issue of critical care , we presented a series of 13 patients undergoing post - cardiotomy extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ( ecmo ) with bivalirudin - based anticoagulation . after this series , we satisfactorily continued this experience , reaching about 20 patients treated . however , we think that a word of caution should be added to our recently published experience . owing to its pharmacological profile , bivaludin is rapidly cleaved by proteolytic enzymes , and its half - life is about 25 minutes when the renal function is normal . the use of bivalimudin for cardiopulmonary bypass ( cpb )    and ecmo   is a feasible option . however, it is recommended that , during cpb , blood stagnation in the circuit be avoided because the rapid cleavage of bivalentudin may result in thrombosis . the ecmo circuit is devoid of a reservoir , and therefore blood stagnation is usually not a circuit- related problem . conversely , under some circumstances , the cardiac chambers may act as a ' natural reservoir ' , which entails blood stagnation and the risk for spontaneous intracardiac thromboosis . this is particularly"

"although the ketogenic diet ( kd ) has been widely accepted as a legitimate and successful therapy for epilepsy and other neurological disorders , its mechanism of action remains an enigma .

 these  primary  influences lead to  secondary  , in part adaptive , effects , for instance changes in mitochondrial density and gene expression . 
 clinically , the influences of the diet are considered as anticonvulsive and neuroprotective , although neuroprotection can also lead to prevention of seizures . 
 potential clinical implications of these mechanisms are discussed .","the kd is comprised of four elements , the changes of any of them can potentially lead to losing its anticonvulsant effect : ( 1 ) increased amount of fat , usually in a ratio of 3 to 4 grams of fat for each gram of protein and carbohydrates , ( 2 ) as low a consumption of glucose as possible , ( 3 ) caloric restriction , and ( 4 ) fluid restriction . the effect of the increased amount/oxidation of ketone bodies seems to be the most prominent of all other suggested antiepileptic mechanisms of the kd . the degradation of the ketone body delivers acetyl - coa directly to the tricarboxylic acid cycle , thus increasing its turnover while bypassing the need to depend on acetyl / coa coming from glycolysis to produce atp . when this transporter is deficient , as in glut 1 deficiency , the k d is the preferred way of antiepsileptic treatment , since it allows for bypassing of the need for glucose . acetone is one of the Ketone bodies that have an anticonstant effect in several types of mouse seizure models . neuroprotection can contribute to the anticoncidant effect , but it may have"

 a strong genotype - phenotype correlation has been observed between hereditary mtc and germ - line  gain of function  mutations of the ret proto - oncogene . 
 most cases of pediatric mtc are hereditary whereas sporadic mtc is rare in children and is usually diagnosed in adults . 
 therefore , mtc in children is most often diagnosed in the course of a familial genetic investigation .

 we performed a retrospective review from the hospital 's electronic microbiological system and calculated resistance rates for each of the standard antimicrobial agents . during the 5-year study period 
 , we studied 151 urine isolates obtained from 128 patients who had an mrsa cultured in their urine sample . 
 there was 100% resistance of all mrsa isolates to flucloxacillin and coamoxiclav . 
 ninety - eight percent of isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin . 
 the resistance rate for trimethoprim was 7.4% and there was only 2.7% resistance for nitrofurantoin . for a clinical subset of patients 
 , we also demonstrated 100% sensitivity for samples tested against teicoplanin and vancomycin . 
 urinary mrsa is an infrequently studied phenomenon , but with the rising trend of hospital superbugs nationally , its management is of critical importance . 
 suitable agents to address this within our population include nitrofurantoin in the well patient requiring urinary mrsa eradication or vancomycin / teicoplanin in the unwell patient requiring intravenous therapy . in all groups , fluoroquinolones should be avoided due to significant resistance rates .","bacteremia itself is associated with bacteriuria in patients infected with sa , which suggests that bacteremic is an important precursor for bacteriure in some patient groups . laboratory diagnosis of mrsa bacteriurium was performed using accredited microbiological microscopy analysis with culture identification criteria and standardized susceptibility testing protocols . over a consecutive 5-year period , the laboratory cultured 425,013 urine samples from all sources , with a mean number of 85,003 specimens per year received ( table 1 ) . a total of 542 unique urine isolates cultured sa and 151 of species ( 27.9% ) were methicillin resistant , meaning that 0.04% of all urine samples tested cultured mrsA . of these 151 samples that tested positive for mRSa , 92 ( 61% ), were from mid - stream urine ( msu ) samples , 50 ( 33% ) from catheter specimen urine ( csu ) types , and 9 ( 6% )were from an unspecified source ( fig . the number of sa isolates grown over the 5 -year study period doubled from 77 in 2010 to 161 in 2014 .the number of m rsa isolates had also increased ; however , the percentage of sa samples"

 this study was performed ( 1 ) to retrospectively analyse the clinico - radiological outcomes of two internal fixation techniques , and ( 2 ) to identify and analyse radiographic fracture patterns of fracture that are associated with this injury.materials and methods : a total of 15 patients underwent osteosynthesis with either ( 1 ) acromioclavicular joint - spanning implants ( group 1 , hook plate device , n = 10 ) or ( 2 ) joint - sparing implants ( group 2 , distal radius plate , n = 5 ) ; these were reviewed at a mean period of 26.1 months ( 12 to 40 months ) . 
 clinical outcomes were measured using constant score ( cs ) , simple shoulder test ( sst ) , and walch acj score ( ws ) . 
 radiographs and ultrasonography were used to assess the glenohumeral and acromioclavicular joints , and the subacromial space . 
 preoperative radiographs were analyzed for assessment of fracture lines to identify radiographic patterns . 
 statistical analysis of the data was performed to determine any significant differences between the two groups.results:the overall clinical outcome was satisfactory ( cs 80.8 , sst 11.3 , ws 17.6 ) and a high union rate ( 93.3% ) was observed . 
 radiographic complications ( acromioclavicular degeneration and subluxation , hook migration , abnormal ossification ) did not negatively influence the final clinical outcomes . 
 four distinct radiographic fracture patterns were observed . 
 a statistically significant difference ( p < 0.05 ) was observed in the reoperation rates between the two groups.conclusions:internal fixation of this fracture pattern is associated with a high union rate and favorable clinical outcomes with both techniques .

 this phenomenon causes a major problem in the development of reliable computed tomographic angiography ( cta ) protocol in the diagnosis of brain death ( bd ) . 
 the aim of our study was to characterize stasis filling in the diagnosis of bd . to achieve this 
 , we performed a dynamic evaluation of contrast enhancement of the cerebral and extracranial arteries in patients with bd and controls.methodsstudy population included 30 bd patients , who showed stasis filling in computed tomographic perfusion ( ctp ) series .

"the 
 synthetic modification of proteins plays an important role 
 in chemical biology and biomaterials science . 
 these fields provide 
 a constant need for chemical tools that can introduce new functionality 
 in specific locations on protein surfaces . in this work 
 , an oxidative 
 strategy is demonstrated for the efficient modification of n - terminal 
 residues on peptides and n - terminal proline residues on proteins . 
 the strategy uses o - aminophenols or o - catechols that are oxidized to active coupling species in 
 situ using potassium ferricyanide . 
 peptide screening results 
 have 
 revealed that many n - terminal amino acids can participate in this 
 reaction , and that proline residues are particularly reactive . 
 when 
 applied to protein substrates , the reaction shows a stronger requirement 
 for the proline group . 
 key advantages of the reaction include its 
 fast second - order kinetics and ability to achieve site - selective modification 
 in a single step using low concentrations of reagent . 
 although free 
 cysteines are also modified by the coupling reaction , they can be 
 protected through disulfide formation and then liberated after n - terminal 
 coupling is complete . 
 this allows access to doubly functionalized 
 bioconjugates that can be difficult to access using other methods .","as an alternative strategy , we and others have developed methods for the selective modification of the n - terminal amino group . while these coupling reactions were found to be highly aniline - selective under the conditions used , several studies have reported the reaction of o - aminophenols and o - catechols with native amino acids , dating back to 1949 . in our previous work , we noted that low amounts of background reactivity could be observed in anilin - based oxidative coupling reactions when higher ph conditions ( > ph 6.5 ) were used . in addition , it was found that the peptides could be modified using naio4 as the oxidant , or 4-methylcatechol as the coupling partner ( supporting information figures s67 ) .The reaction of 2-amino - p - cresol with three different peptides was monitored over the course of 1 h ( figure 1d ) .

"microwave imaging techniques are prone to signal corruption from unwanted multipath signals . 
 near - field systems are especially vulnerable because signals can scatter and reflect from structural objects within or on the boundary of the imaging zone . 
 these issues are further exacerbated when surface waves are generated with the potential of propagating along the transmitting and receiving antenna feed lines and other low - loss paths . in this paper 
 , we analyze the contributions of multi - path signals arising from surface wave effects . 
 specifically , experiments were conducted with a near - field microwave imaging array positioned at variable heights from the floor of a coupling fluid tank . 
 antenna arrays with different feed line lengths in the fluid were also evaluated . 
 the results show that surface waves corrupt the received signals over the longest transmission distances across the measurement array . however , the surface wave effects can be eliminated provided the feed line lengths are sufficiently long independently of the distance of the transmitting / receiving antenna tips from the imaging tank floor . 
 theoretical predictions confirm the experimental observations .","however , surface waves can cause multipath signals that can be especially difficult to eliminate in near - field systems . for a 15  db multipath signal , these values increase to 1.42  db and 10.24. clearly , the resultant phase and amplitude errors can become very significant for multipath stems that are on the same order of magnitude as the desired signals . if a is the amplitude of the incident plane wave , then the magnetic component of the incidence and transmitted waves can be represented as ( 3)hy = ae[jh1xjz ] ,  x>0,hy = e[Jh1 xjz ],  x<0 , where h1 +  = k1 and h2 + = k2 are needed to satisfy the wave equation , k1 & k2 as the wave numbers for the two regions , and  is the propagation constant . in this situation , we are primarily interested in surface waves propagating along the outside of a coaxial cable , and their associated attenuation as a function of distance after the mode has been sufficiently established . the fields transmitted into the surrounding space can be determined from the distribution at the coaxial opening which can be found by solving the"

 this study aimed to uncover the effects of baicalin in aki during pediatric sepsis.material/methodsblood urea nitrogen ( bun ) and serum creatinine ( cr ) levels were detected in 50 pediatric patients , who underwent basic therapy with or without baicalin adjunctive therapy . 
 mouse sepsis models were constructed by cecal ligation and puncture ( clp ) and treated with baicalin intragastrically , after which bun and cr examination , tunel apoptosis assay , and expression analyses of bax and bcl2 were performed.resultsbaicalin adjunctive therapy significantly decreased bun and cr levels in pediatric sepsis patients ( p<0.05 ) . 
 clp led to elevated bun and cr levels in the mouse model ( p<0.01 ) , indicating kidney injury accompanied by sepsis . 
 baicalin decreased bun and cr levels ( p<0.05 ) , and reduced the apoptotic cell percent in the renal tissue ( p<0.05 ) of the clp model . 
 it inhibited bax and promoted bcl2 in the renal tissue , which was consistent with cell apoptosis changes.conclusionsbaicalin is capable of suppressing renal cell apoptosis and protecting against aki in pediatric sepsis . 
 this study provides a potential adjunctive therapy for treating aki in pediatric sepsis , and further research is necessary to reveal its deeper mechanisms .","acute kidney injury ( aki ) is a severe consequence of sepsis and mods , and about 1527% of aki in children is generated from pediatric sepsIS . total rna samples of the mouse renal tissue were extracted by trizol ( invitrogen , carlsbad , ca ) according to the manufacturer s instructions . totalrna samples and the mouse regulatory tissue were extraction by triozol ( Invitrogen ), carlsad , ca ), according tothe manufacturer s recommendations . gapdh ( ab181602 ) was used as an internal control . both bun and cr levels were significantly decreased in the clp + baicalin group ( p=0.0181 and 0.0225 ) , indicating that baicalen treatment effectively alleviated kidney injury in the Clp - induced mouse sepsys model . tunel assay showed more apoptotic cells in the CLp group compared to the sham group , and baicali treatment reduced apoptotic cell numbers ( figure 3a ) , with significant differences between groups ( p<0.0087 and 0 0.0359 , figure 3b ) . bax and bcl2 , 2 factors indicating cell apoptosis , were detected at"
"the receptor for advanced glycation end - products ( rages ) is associated with the malignancy of cancer .

"the song of zebra finch is stable in life after it was learned successfully . 
 vocal plasticity is thought to be a motor exploration that can support continuous learning and optimization of performance . 
 the activity of ra , an important pre - motor nucleus in songbird 's brain , influences the song directly . 
 this variability in adult birdsong is associated with the activity of nmda receptors in lman - ra synapses , but the detailed mechanism is unclear . 
 the control of gain refers to modulation of a neuron 's responsiveness to input and is critically important for normal sensory , cognitive , and motor functions . here , we observed the change of gain in ra projection neurons after exogenous nmda was applied to activate nmda receptors using the whole - cell current clamp recording . 
 we found that nmda substantially increased the slope ( gain ) of the firing rate - current relationship in ra projection neurons . 
 the ampa receptor - dependent excitability played a crucial role in the modulation of gain by nmda . 
 these results suggested that nmda receptors may regulate the dynamics of ra projection neurons by input - output gain .","it has been observed that ra received excitatory glutamatergic inputs from hvc and lman . lman - ra synaptic transmission is necessary for the variability of song in adult zebra finch , suggesting that the activity of nmda receptor on the lman / ra synapses might induce the activity pattern change of ra neurons and change the bursts that control the vocal and respiratory muscles . such gain changes are frequently observed in the responses of cortical neurons and are thought to play an important role in neural computations . the recording pipettes , which had resistances ranging from 3 to 5  m , were positioned using an integrated motorized control system ( sutter instruments , usa ) . the slopes of the f - i relationships were 246.92  28.00  hz / na before nmda application and increased to 325.49  73.34 furthermore , the input resistances were decreased by 20  m nmda in ra projection neurons ( p < 0.05 , n = 6 ) ( figure 2 ) . to test the effect of nmDA on spike ahp comparison of spike shape is shown in figure 3(a ) with 90  pa current injection before and after nmda administration . nmda increased"

 although the standard of care for testing for hiv and other sexually transmitted infections includes disclosure in the presence of a guardian for adolescents under age 18 , we conclude that more research about the risks and benefits of disclosure to adolescents in the context of a clinical trial is needed . 
 notably , current serological diagnosis for hsv-2 has a low positive predictive value when prevalence is low , resulting in an unacceptable proportion of false positives and serious concerns about disclosing test results to adolescents within a trial .

"background : bipolar hip arthroplasty ( bha ) is one of the options for treatment of avascular necrosis ( avn ) of the femoral head . 
 acetabular erosion and groin pain are the most allowing for gross motion between the common complications . 
 we propose that these complications are secondary to improper acetabular preparation allowing for motion between the bha head and the acetabulum.materials and methods : the current study retrospectively evaluated patientsrecords from case files and also called them for clinical and radiological followup . 
 96 hips with avn of the femoral head treated with bha were included in the study . 
 all patients were males with a mean age of 42 years ( range 30 - 59 years ) . in all cases , 
 the acetabulum was gently reamed till it became uniformly concentric to achieve tight fitting trial cup . 
 clinical followup using harris hip score ( hhs ) and radiological study for cup migration were done at followup.results:the mean followup was 7.52 years ( range 4 - 16 years ) . 
 the hhs significantly improved from a preoperative value of 39.3 ( range , 54 - 30 ) to a postoperative value of 89.12 ( range 74 - 96 ) . according to hhs grades , the final outcome was excellent in 52 hips , good in 28 and fair in 16 hips . 
 hip and groin pain was reported in four hips ( 5% ) , but did not limit activity .

"valproic acid ( vpa ) has successfully been used in the therapy of a number of conditions including absence seizures , partial seizures , tonic - clonic seizures , bipolar disorder , schizoaffective disorder , social phobias , neuropathic pain and migraine headaches . 
 there is a high rise in number of cases of toxicity due to overdose of vpa . 
 hyperammonemia , a common side - effect of vpa , is caused by several proposed etiologies , reported as having uncertain correlation with vpa dose or concentration . 
 we present here a case of a 25-year - old female patient with a past history of psychiatric complaints , presented with elevated serum vpa levels associated with elevated venous ammonia levels subsequent to vpa overdose . later in the presence of sub - therapeutic serum vpa levels 
 her venous ammonia levels remained raised and slowly down - trending . 
 vpa levels and ammonia levels were found to be normal after 14 days . 
 patient was treated with levocarnitine . 
 her liver enzymes were never elevated . 
 different decay kinetics of venous ammonia in presence of high and low concentrations of vpa indicates that vpa can cause symptomatic hyperammonemia via more than one concurrent etiological mechanism . in this patient , 
 the mechanisms causing hyperammonia secondary to vpa use were not related to hepatic damage or carnitine deficiency .","her elevated vpa levels were associated with elevated ammonia levels as expected of a positive correlation . in contrast , later on in the patient 's clinical course her raised venous ammonia levels were found to be slowly down - trending in the presence of sub - therapeutic serum vpa . patient was taking paroxetine 20 mg for depression ; this was incremented to 40 mg at the time vpa was started . after ingesting the pills she notified her family who then brought her to the emergency room . subsequently , she was administered oral lactulose once and then 1400 mg of levocarnitine orally every 6 h for the next 2 days . her vpa values which peaked after admission continued to trend down over the next 4 days , the ammonia levels also peaked subsequent to admission then showed an initial dip followed by a very slow down - trend [ figure 1a ] . the normalized log - linear plot of vpa serum concentration over time showed a down - progressing linear first - order kinetics with a calculated t = 15.08 h [ figure1b ] ( expected t for depakote : 9 - 16 h following oral dosing regimens of 250 - 1000 mg . at 14 days laboratory values of the patient at the point"
"treatment of mastitis should be based on bacteriological diagnosis and take national and international guidelines on prudent use of antimicrobials into account . in acute mastitis , where bacteriological diagnosis is not available , treatment should be initiated based on herd data and personal experience . 
 rapid bacteriological diagnosis would facilitate the proper selection of the antimicrobial . 
 treating subclinical mastitis with antimicrobials during lactation is seldom economical , because of high treatment costs and generally poor efficacy . 
 all mastitis treatment should be evidence - based , i.e. , the efficacy of each product and treatment length should be demonstrated by scientific studies . 
 use of on - farm written protocols for mastitis treatment promotes a judicious use of antimicrobials and reduces the use of antimicrobials .","intramammary infection ( mastitis ) is the most common reason for the use of antimicrobials in dairy cows . cure rates for mastitis caused by penicillin - resistant strains of s. aureus seem to be inferior to those of mastitis due to penicill - susceptible strains . the advantages of this route are high concentrations of the substance achieved in the milk and low consumption of the antimicrobial as the drug is directly infused into the diseased quarter . efficacy of imm treatment varies according to the causative pathogen , with the best therapeutic response being shown for mastits caused by streptococci , coagulase - negative staphylococci ), and corynebacterium spp .. where to target antimicrobial therapy in clinical mastitis based to different pathogens   the systemic route of administration has been suggested to be more efficient than imm for the treatment of clinical Mastitis as antimicrobiials theoretically have better penetration of the udder tissue by this route . however , it is difficult to attain and maintain therapeutic concentrations in milk or uddder residue following systemic administration . macrolides would have ideal pharmacokinetics , but clinical studies have failed to demonstrate efficacy when used"
"abstractmany pathogens of humans are blood borne , including hiv , malaria , hepatitis b and c , west nile virus , dengue , and other viral hemorrhagic fevers . 
 although several of these pathogens are transmitted by blood - feeding arthropods , hiv is not . 
 a number of properties of hiv and its life cycle have been identified as proximate explanations for the absence of arthropod transmission , but little consideration has been given to why hiv has not evolved this form of transmission . 
 we consider the empirical evidence for arthropod transmission , and suggest that mechanical transmission has not evolved in hiv because such strains would induce a faster onset of aids during infection , which would thereby limit their ability to spread . on the other hand , it is not as clear why biological transmission has not occurred . 
 available data suggests that a lack of appropriate genetic variation in hiv is one explanation , but it is also possible that a conflict between natural selection occurring within and between infected individuals has prevented its evolution instead . 
 we discuss the potential significance of these ideas , and argue that taking such an evolutionary perspective broadens our understanding of infectious diseases and the potential consequences of public health interventions .","even if this does occur , however , the viral levels of hiv in humans are thought to be about 10 to 100 times lower than that of some hepatitis viruses ( foil and issel 1991 ) , again implicating hivs low titre during infection of humans as the primary reason that mechanical transmission does not occur in this virus . biological transmission : despite evidence that mechanical mechanical transmission of humaniv by arthropods can occur , there is no evidence that biological transmission is possible . this model is analyzed in appendix 1 to show that the asymptotic per capita rate of increase , r , is defined implicitly , as a function of various epidemiological parameters , by the equation : some of the parameters in equation ( 4 ) will depend on the level of viremia in humans , and therefore viremic will affect the per capita rates of spread of human . therefore , some or all of the above conditions must hold if this analysis is to explain why hiv has not evolved mechanical vector transmission . for example , it would be useful to know by how much arthropod must increase the overall transmission rate of human if such strains are to have increased significantly in frequency during the period of time in which hiv have been evolving in humans ."
"summarybackgroundin a healthy kidney , contractile protein alpha - smooth muscle actin ( asma ) is immunohistochemically strongly expressed only in the blood vessels , while in pathological conditions it can be visualized in glomerular mesangial cells and interstitial myofibroblasts . 
 the aim of this study was to explore the possible correlation between expression of asma in glomerulonephritis ( gn ) and indicators of renal function.material/methodswe analyzed expression of asma in percutaneous renal biopsy of 142 adult and pediatric patients with gn and its correlation with blood pressure , serum creatinine , creatinine clearance and 24-hour urine protein at the time of biopsy . 
 immunoexpression of asma was analyzed quantitatively using computer - assisted morphometric analysis . 
 relative surface of asma expression in all glomeruli and interstitium was calculated for each patient.resultsin adults and children , greater expression of asma in interstitium was associated with higher serum creatinine and reduced creatinine clearance . 
 conversely , greater asma expression in glomeruli was associated with normal or decreased serum creatinine in adults and increased creatinine clearance in children . in children , correlation was found between high blood pressure and asma expression in interstitium.conclusionswe confirmed that interstitial expression of asma is associated with reduced renal function at time of biopsy . 
 the connection of asma expression in glomeruli with lower serum creatinine and normal or increased creatinine clearance suggests a favorable role of this phenotypic change in glomerular filtration rate ; further investigation is needed .","the 24-hour urine protein was corrected for body surface area and categorized according to 95% confidence limits . the expression of asma in glomeruli and interstitium was not significantly different between pg and npg categories of gn in both children and adults ( table 1 ) . in adults , expression ofasma in interstitial and in glomersuli were not significantly differ between patients with high and normal blood pressure ( 10.714.9% vs. 9.912.6% , p=0.692 ) and ( 13.69.5% vs vs. 12.97.8% ,p=1.00 ) , respectively . in children , positive correlation was found between asma expression in interstatitium and absolute value of sc ( r=-0.45 , p =0.002 ) ( figure 3a ) , the expression level of asm in glglomeruli and in intersttium was no significantly differentbetween pg and nonpg categories for gn inboth children and adult ( table1 ) .in adults , expressions of asmat in interstructitiumand in glomuli were no significantly difference between patientswith high and norm blood pressure  10.712.9 %"

 the aim of this study was to examine the effects of parental rearing on attitudes toward suicide among japanese medical college students.methodswe examined the association between parental bonding and attitudes toward suicide in 160 medical college students in japan . 
 the parental bonding instrument was used to assess the attitudes and behaviors of parents . 
 the attitudes toward suicide were evaluated using the japanese version of the attitudes toward suicide questionnaire.resultsthe mean age of the subjects was 25.24.0 years old . 
 the majority of the participants in our study agreed that anyone could commit suicide ( 88.8% ) and that suicide is preventable ( 86.3% ) . after adjusting for age and sex , multivariate regression analysis revealed that maternal care approached a statistically significant association with the  right to suicide  attitude . under the same conditions , 
 maternal care was shown to be significantly associated with the  common occurrence  attitude . 
 no other significant relationships were observed between parental bonding and attitudes toward suicide.conclusionthis study suggests that a higher level of maternal care ensures that children think that suicide occurs less commonly . 
 the promotion of best practices for suicide prevention among medical students is needed . 
 child rearing support might be associated with suicide prevention .","among medical staff members , negative attitudes toward suicide such as anger could affect nontherapeutic reactions to suicidal individuals.4 furthermore , a belief that suicide is a personal right was negatively related to suicide intervention skills.5 an accurate assessment of the attitudes toward Suicide held by medical staff member is relevant . although few studies have assessed the relationship between parental bonding and mental conditions among medical staff staff members,9,10 no study has evaluated the association between maternal bonding and attitudes toward suicidal . the objective of this study was to investigate whether parental bonding is associated with attitudes toward SU among medical college students in japan . the parental bonding instrument ( pbi ) was administered to each participant to measure the attitudes and behavior of the parents.11 the pbi is a 25 item self - rating instrument by which individuals over the age of 16 report their experiences of being parented to the ageof 16 . a total of 12 items measure the dimension of care , and 13 items measure protection , both on a likert scale . we employed the japanese version of the attitude toward suicide questionnaire ( atts ) to assess the attitudes towards suicide held by the study participants.12 we employed a six factor model that was previously developed in studies of japanococ attitudes ,"

"the glycosylation abilities of snails deserve attention , because snail species serve as intermediate hosts in the developmental cycles of some human and cattle parasites . in analogy to many other host - pathogen relations , the glycosylation of snail proteins may likewise contribute to these host - parasite interactions . here 
 we present an overview on the o - glycan structures of 8 different snails ( land and water snails , with or without shell ) : arion lusitanicus , achatina fulica , biomphalaria glabrata , cepaea hortensis , clea helena , helix pomatia , limax maximus and planorbarius corneus . 
 the o - glycans were released from the purified snail proteins by -elimination . 
 further analysis was carried out by liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray ionization mass spectrometry and  for the main structures  by gas chromatography / mass spectrometry . 
 snail o - glycans are built from the four monosaccharide constituents : n - acetylgalactosamine , galactose , mannose and fucose . 
 an additional modification is a methylation of the hexoses . 
 the common trisaccharide core structure was determined in arion lusitanicus to be n - acetylgalactosamine linked to the protein elongated by two 4-o - methylated galactose residues . 
 further elongations by methylated and unmethylated galactose and mannose residues and/or fucose are present . 
 the typical snail o - glycan structures are different to those so far described . 
 similar to snail n - glycan structures they display methylated hexose residues .","unlike the n - glycans they may be linked to several different amino acid residues ( very often serine or threonine , but also hydroxylysine , tyrosine or hydroxyproline ) of the protein and their occurrence can not be predicted easily by a common consensus sequence . the preparation of o - glycands was carried out via -elimination followed by further separation steps . the high amount of 4-o - me - gal indicated that this residue is the one which is mainly involved in the elongation of the glycan . minor compounds were identified as contaminations by n - glyans ( glcnac and man ) or storage glycans ( lc and gal ) . combining these data , the main o - glycan structure of a. lusitanicus was elucidated as a trisaccharide containing two terminal 4-O - methylated galactoses which are 3- and 6-linked to an inner galnac residue ( fig . 5).fig 3linkage analysis of the core trisapcharide - alditol from a.lusitanica ( a ) selected ion chromatogram ( m / z 145 and m / Z 318 ) of partially methyl"
